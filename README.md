# 🛡️ Goon-Not – Mindful Media Replacement Extension

**Goon-Not** is a Chrome extension designed to help you regain focus and reduce exposure to explicit content online. Instead of blocking websites entirely, it takes a gentler approach by replacing images and videos with wholesome, user-provided GIFs — and optionally playing uplifting audio instead of unwanted sounds.
